This is a React-based web application for a social media platform. The project uses TypeScript and follows the Airbnb style guide.
Please follow these coding standards:
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Prefer const over let for variable declarations
- Use camelCase for variable and function names, PascalCase for component names
When suggesting code, please use the following libraries:
- React Router for navigation
- Redux for state management
- Styled-components for CSS-in-JS styling
- File structure:
- src/components: Reusable UI components
- src/pages: Top-level page components
- src/utils: Helper functions and utilities
- src/api: API service functions
- Performance guidelines:
- Use React.memo for pure functional components
- Implement lazy loading for route components
- Optimize useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Testing requirements:
- Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage
- Include snapshot tests for UI components
- Documentation guidelines:
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Include PropTypes for all components
- Maintain a README.md file in each major directory
- Error handling:
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement a global error boundary component
- Log errors to a monitoring service (e.g., Sentry)
